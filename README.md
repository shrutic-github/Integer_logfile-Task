1. Analyzing the Log File
Goal: Identify patterns and table structures in the log file.
Process:
Opened and reviewed the log file.
Located START and END markers that define the boundaries of each table.
Identified six tables with the following names:
ALARM STATUS
AVG PRB BRANCH RSSI
AVG PER BRANCH RSSI
RFBRANCH STATUS
BASIC DETAIL
HARDWARE INVENTORY
Each table has rows separated by semicolons (;), which act as column separators.
2. Writing ChatGPT Prompts
Goal: Use ChatGPT to refine and improve data extraction.
Prompts Used:
“Identify all START and END markers in the log file and extract data in between.”
“Split the extracted data using ‘;’ as a separator to create a structured table.”
“Format extracted tables properly and prepare for conversion to Excel.”
Refinement: Modified prompts to handle cases where data rows had inconsistent spacing or unexpected patterns.
3. Extracting Data and Saving to Excel
Goal: Extract and organize table data in an Excel file.
Process:
Used Python to:
Open and read the log file.
Identify and extract data between START and END markers.
Split rows using ; as a delimiter to create structured data.
Save each table in a separate Excel sheet.
Saved data in Extracted_table_data.xlsx.
4. Documenting the Process
Goal: Explain how extraction was performed.
Steps:
Log File Analysis: Found table patterns using START and END markers.
Pattern Matching: Applied regex to identify and extract the desired table data.
Data Splitting: Separated data using semicolons (;) to form clean tables.
Excel Writing: Wrote data to separate sheets in an Excel file.
